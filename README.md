Each element has a specific color property and has a unique dynamic behavior to interact with other surrounding elements.

- Sand : sinks at bottom of water and air.
- Water : sinks below air but rises above sand. Also tends to spread horizontally.
- Air : rises above water and sand. Gases like smoke spread through the air.
- Wood : wood is a static solid. wood in this game is like a structure building material and is fixed, doesn't interact with other elements (except fire burns it: todo).
- Fire : TODO. (burns wood)
